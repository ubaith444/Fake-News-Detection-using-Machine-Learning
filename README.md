Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Given a dataset of news headlines/articles, the goal is to classify each entry as real or fake.

## Goal
- Build a machine learning model that classifies news as real or fake.
- Use TF-IDF for feature extraction.
- Compare performance across different classifiers.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF)

## ML Pipeline
1. Import Necessary Libraries
2. Load Dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Data Preprocessing (nulls, text cleaning)
5. TF-IDF Vectorization
6. Split into Train/Test sets
7. Model Building (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes)
8. Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, F1 Score)

## Results
| Model               | Accuracy | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
|--------------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression| 95.1%    | 0.951    | 0.97    |
| Naive Bayes        | 92.4%    | 0.923    | 0.94    |
| SVM (Linear)       | 94.5%    | 0.944    | 0.96    |

## Dataset
